# This will load the chunks from cache, clear the downstream caches (concepts, decisions, etc.),
# and re-run the pipeline starting from the 'concepts' extraction step.
python -m src.cached_schema_org_pipeline --resume-from concepts


python -m src.cached_schema_org_pipeline --resume-from [STEP_NAME]


resume-from 	Value	What it SKIPS (Loads from Cache)	What it RUNS	Best Use Case
start		Nothing	All Steps				A full, clean run on new data.
chunks		Nothing	All Steps				(Identical to start for this script)
concepts	Step 1 (Chunks)					Steps 2, 5, 6, 7, 8	You changed the LLM prompts for extraction.
decisions	Steps 1, 2 (Chunks, Concepts)			Steps 5, 6, 7, 8	You changed the similarity thresholds or logic.
schema		Steps 1, 2, 5 (Chunks, Concepts, Decisions)	Steps 6, 7, 8	You changed the Schema.org JSON-LD formatting.
graph		Steps 1, 2, 5, 6, 7				Step 8 only	You only changed the Neo4j graph building logic.


# Need to run afterwards
