# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing ontology extraction pipeline by integrating LangChain framework with the current OpenAI-based approach to create implicit ontologies from electrotechnical datasheets. The enhancement will leverage LangChain's structured output capabilities, prompt templates, and chain composition to extract not just explicit component data, but also implicit relationships, hierarchies, and domain knowledge that can be inferred from the technical documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to migrate from direct OpenAI API calls to LangChain framework, so that I can leverage better prompt management, structured outputs, and chain composition capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes a datasheet THEN it SHALL use LangChain's ChatOpenAI model instead of direct OpenAI client calls
2. WHEN structured extraction is performed THEN the system SHALL use LangChain's structured output with Pydantic models
3. WHEN prompts are managed THEN the system SHALL use LangChain's PromptTemplate for consistent and maintainable prompts
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing JSON output format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Pydantic models for structured data validation, so that the extracted component data is type-safe and follows a consistent schema.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component data is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate it against predefined Pydantic models
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which fields are invalid
3. WHEN nested properties are processed THEN the system SHALL handle complex data structures with proper type validation
4. WHEN the model schema changes THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle version compatibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to implement chain composition for multi-step processing, so that I can break down complex extraction tasks into manageable, reusable components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing datasheets THEN the system SHALL use LangChain chains to sequence extraction steps
2. WHEN chains are composed THEN the system SHALL support preprocessing, extraction, and post-processing stages
3. WHEN chain execution fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information for each step
4. WHEN chains are reused THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of different chain combinations for different component types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want improved prompt engineering capabilities, so that I can create more effective and maintainable prompts for different types of electrotechnical components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompts are created THEN the system SHALL use LangChain's PromptTemplate with variable substitution
2. WHEN different component types are processed THEN the system SHALL support component-specific prompt templates
3. WHEN prompts need updates THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification without code changes
4. WHEN prompt performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL support A/B testing of different prompt variations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms, so that the system can gracefully handle API failures and temporary issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry logic
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL pause and resume processing automatically
3. WHEN parsing errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative extraction strategies
4. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to extract implicit ontological relationships and hierarchies from datasheets, so that I can capture domain knowledge that is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the technical content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing component datasheets THEN the system SHALL infer implicit relationships between components, properties, and concepts
2. WHEN analyzing technical specifications THEN the system SHALL identify implicit taxonomic hierarchies and classification patterns
3. WHEN extracting domain knowledge THEN the system SHALL capture implicit constraints, dependencies, and semantic relationships
4. WHEN generating ontologies THEN the system SHALL represent both explicit facts and inferred implicit knowledge in the RDF graph

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to test different OpenAI models for extraction quality comparison, so that I can optimize performance and cost for different types of electrotechnical components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is configured THEN it SHALL support switching between different OpenAI models (gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4o, etc.)
2. WHEN different models are tested THEN the system SHALL track extraction quality, processing time, and cost metrics
3. WHEN model performance is compared THEN the system SHALL generate comparative reports showing accuracy and efficiency
4. WHEN optimal models are identified THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of model selection based on component complexity
