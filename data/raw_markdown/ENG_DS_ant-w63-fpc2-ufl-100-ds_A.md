## ANT-W63-FPC2-UFL-100

## Flexible Embedded WiFi 6 Antenna

The Linx W63-FPC2 antenna is a flexible embedded multiband antenna offering excellent performance for WiFi 6E applications in the 6 GHz band (5.925 GHz to 7.125 GHz) plus 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi/WLAN for WiFi 5 and WiFi 6 solutions.

The W63-FPC2 provides a ground plane independent dipole embedded antenna solution comparable in performance to an external antenna. The flexibility and adhesive backing makes the W63-FPC2 antenna easy to mount in unique and custom enclosures, while enabling an environmentally sealed enclosure and protection from tampering or accidental antenna damage.

Connection is made to the radio via a 100 mm (3.94 in) long, 1.13 mm coaxial cable terminated in a U.FL-type plug (female socket) connector.

## ANTENNA MOUNTING

The ANT-W63-FPC2-UFL-100 is a flexible, adhesive backed antenna that allows it to be permanently installed onto non-metallic surfaces. The adhesive backing is 3M 467MP™/200MP, which provides outstanding adhesion to high surface energy plastics. The adhesive delivers excellent shear strength to resist slippage and edge lifting, but can be repositioned temporarily to allow for repositioning. This adhesive is highly resistant to solvents, humidity and moisture, as well as heat up to 204 °C (400 °F) for short periods.

The antenna should never be bent to the point of creating a crease or allowing the angle of the bend to fall below 90 degrees (i.e. become acute) as this will impair function and may cause permanent damage.

## VSWR

Figure 2 provides the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) across the antenna bandwidth. VSWR describes the power reflected from the antenna back to the radio. A lower VSWR value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency. Reflected power is also shown on the right-side vertical axis as a gauge of the percentage of transmitter power reflected back from the antenna.

## RETURN LOSS

Return loss (Figure 3), represents the loss in power at the antenna due to reflected signals. Like VSWR, a lower return loss value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency.

## PEAK GAIN

The peak gain across the antenna bandwidth is shown in Figure 4. Peak gain represents the maximum antenna input power concentration across 3-dimensional space, and therefore peak performance, at a given frequency, but does not consider any directionality in the gain pattern.

## AVERAGE GAIN

Average gain (Figure 5), is the average of all antenna gain in 3-dimensional space at each frequency, providing an indication of overall performance without expressing antenna directionality.

## RADIATION EFFICIENCY

Radiation efficiency (Figure 6), shows the ratio of power delivered to the antenna relative to the power radiated at the antenna, expressed as a percentage, where a higher percentage indicates better performance at a given frequency.

## RADIATION PATTERNS

Radiation patterns provide information about the directionality and 3-dimensional gain performance of the antenna by plotting gain at specific frequencies in three orthogonal planes. Antenna radiation patterns (Figure 7), are shown using polar plots covering 360 degrees. The antenna graphic above the plots provides reference to the plane of the column of plots below it. Note: when viewed with typical PDF viewing software, zooming into radiation patterns is possible to reveal fine detail.
