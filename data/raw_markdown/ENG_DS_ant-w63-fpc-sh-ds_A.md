## ANT-W63-FPC-SH Series

## Flexible Embedded WiFi 6/6E FPC Antennas

The Linx ANT-W63-FPC-SH series antennas are 25 mm x 20 mm adhesive flexible printed circuit (FPC) antennas for WiFi 6/WiFi 6E applications in the 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands.

The ANT-W63-FPC-SH antennas provide a ground plane independent dipole internal/embedded antenna solution. The flexibility and adhesive backing make the ANT-W63-FPC-SH series easy to mount in RF transparent (e.g. plastic) enclosures, enabling environmental sealing and for protection from antenna damage.

Connection is made to the radio via a coaxial cable terminated in an MHF1/U.FL-type plug (female socket), or MHF4 plug (female socket) connector.

## PACKAGING INFORMATION

The ANT-W63-FPC-SH antennas are packaged in bags of 100 pcs. Distribution channels may offer alternative packaging options.

## ANTENNA MOUNTING

The ANT-W63-FPC-SH antenna is a flexible, adhesive backed antenna that allows it to be permanently installed onto non-metallic surfaces. The adhesive backing is 3M 467MP™/200MP, which provides outstanding adhesion to high surface energy plastics. The adhesive delivers excellent shear strength to resist slippage and edge lifting, but can be repositioned before the adhesive cures, allowing for accurate positioning. This adhesive is highly resistant to solvents, humidity and moisture, as well as heat up to 204 °C (400 °F) for short periods.

The antenna should never be bent to the point of creating a crease or allowing the angle of the bend to fall below 90 degrees (i.e. become acute) as this will impair function and may cause permanent damage.

## PRODUCT DIMENSIONS

Figure 1 provides dimensions for the ANT-W63-FPC-SH series antenna.

## VSWR

Figure 2 provides the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) across the antenna bandwidth. VSWR describes the power reflected from the antenna back to the radio. A lower VSWR value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency. Reflected power is also shown on the right-side vertical axis as a gauge of the percentage of transmitter power reflected back from the antenna.

## RETURN LOSS

Return loss (Figure 3), represents the loss in power at the antenna due to reflected signals. Like VSWR, a lower return loss value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency.

Figure 3. ANT-W63-FPC-SH Antenna Return Loss with Frequency Band Highlights

## PEAK GAIN

The peak gain across the antenna bandwidth is shown in Figure 4. Peak gain represents the maximum antenna input power concentration across 3-dimensional space, and therefore peak performance, at a given frequency, but does not consider any directionality in the gain pattern.

Figure 4. ANT-W63-FPC-SH Antenna Peak Gain with Frequency Band Highlights

## AVERAGE GAIN

Average gain (Figure 5), is the average of all antenna gain in 3-dimensional space at each frequency, providing an indication of overall performance without expressing antenna directionality.

Figure 5. ANT-W63-FPC-SH Antenna Average Gain with Frequency Band Highlights

## RADIATION EFFICIENCY

Radiation efficiency (Figure 6), shows the ratio of power delivered to the antenna relative to the power radiated at the antenna, expressed as a percentage, where a higher percentage indicates better performance at a given frequency.

Figure 6. ANT-W63-FPC-SH Antenna Radiation Efficiency with Frequency Band Highlights

## RADIATION PATTERNS

Radiation patterns provide information about the directionality and 3-dimensional gain performance of the antenna by plotting gain at specific frequencies in three orthogonal planes. Antenna radiation patterns

(Figure 7), are shown using polar plots covering 360 degrees. The antenna graphic above the plots provides reference to the plane of the column of plots below it. Note: when viewed with typical PDF viewing software, zooming into radiation patterns is possible to reveal fine detail.
