Maximum enclosure wall thickness =

10.0 mm (0.39 in)

## PACKAGING INFORMATION

Ø54.0 mm (2.13 in)

The ANT-W63-SPNF1 antenna is individually placed in a polyethylene bag. 10 pcs. are sealed in larger polyethylene bags. Distribution channels may offer alternative packaging options).

## ANTENNA MOUNTING

The ANT-W63-SPNF1 antenna is an externally mounted multiband antenna that can be permanently installed onto metallic and non-metallic surfaces up to 10.0 mm (0.25 in) thick. The antenna terminates in a 5/8'-24UNEF threaded N connector shaft which doubles as the mounting base and is provided with a protective rubber boot, washer and hex nut. Torque applied the the hex nut should not exceed 1N-M (8.85 in-lb). The mounting hole dimensions are shown in Figure 2.

## VSWR

Figure 3 provides the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) across the antenna bandwidth. VSWR describes the power reflected from the antenna back to the radio. A lower VSWR value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency. Reflected power is also shown on the right-side vertical axis as a gauge of the percentage of transmitter power reflected back from the antenna.

## RETURN LOSS

Return loss (Figure 4), represents the loss in power at the antenna due to reflected signals. Like VSWR, a lower return loss value indicates better antenna performance at a given frequency.

## PEAK GAIN

The peak gain across the antenna bandwidth is shown in Figure 5. Peak gain represents the maximum antenna input power concentration across 3-dimensional space, and therefore peak performance at a given frequency, but does not consider any directionality in the gain pattern.

## AVERAGE GAIN

Average gain (Figure 6), is the average of all antenna gain in 3-dimensional space at each frequency, providing an indication of overall performance without expressing antenna directionality.

## RADIATION EFFICIENCY

Radiation efficiency (Figure 7), shows the ratio of power delivered to the antenna relative to the power radiated at the antenna, expressed as a percentage, where a higher percentage indicates better performance at a given frequency.

## RADIATION PATTERNS

Radiation patterns provide information about the directionality and 3-dimensional gain performance of the antenna by plotting gain at specific frequencies in three orthogonal planes. Antenna radiation patterns are shown in Figure 8 using polar plots covering 360 degrees. The antenna graphic at the top of the page provides reference to the plane of the column of plots below it. Note: when viewed with typical PDF viewing software, zooming into radiation patterns is possible to reveal fine detail.
