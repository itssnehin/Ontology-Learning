# Schema.org Ontology Extraction & Intelligent Extension Pipeline

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent pipeline for extracting Schema.org ontologies from technical datasheets and automatically deciding whether to extend the ontology with new concepts or map to existing ones. The system combines large language models (LLMs), embedding-based similarity matching, and domain-specific technical property analysis to maintain ontology quality while ensuring comprehensive coverage.

## üöÄ Streamlining the Pipeline for Efficiency

Ontology extraction, especially with large language models, can be time-consuming and expensive. This project includes several features and best practices to streamline the process for both development and production runs.

### 1. Caching LLM and Embedding Results
The most significant bottleneck is repeatedly calling the OpenAI API. The `cached_schema_org_pipeline.py` script implements a caching mechanism to avoid this.

- **How it Works**: Each time a result is fetched from the LLM (for concept extraction, relation extraction, etc.), it is saved to the `cache/` directory. On subsequent runs, if the input chunk is unchanged, the result is loaded directly from the cache instead of making a new API call.
- **Benefit**: This saves enormous amounts of time and money during development and allows you to re-run the pipeline from any point without reprocessing everything.
- **Usage**: For most development work, **the cached pipeline should be your default**. Use `python -m src.cached_schema_org_pipeline --resume-from <step>` to restart the pipeline from a specific stage (e.g., `concepts`, `schema`, `graph`).

### 2. Efficient Database Transactions
All graph updates for a batch of concepts are wrapped in a single Neo4j transaction.

- **Benefit**: Reduces thousands of individual network requests and database commits into one, providing a significant performance boost over single-query approaches.
- **Best Practice**: This is already implemented in the graph builder modules. Always group related write operations (`MERGE`, `CREATE`) into a single `session.execute_write()` block.

### 3. Parallel Execution
The extraction process for each source document is independent. For very large datasets, this step can be parallelized.

- **Benefit**: Drastically reduces the total runtime on multi-core machines.
- **Implementation**: Use Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to process multiple documents simultaneously, which is especially effective for I/O-bound tasks like making API calls.

### 4. Using the Ontology Management Dashboard
The backend server (`ontology_management_backend.py`) is designed to support a web dashboard for managing the pipeline.

- **Benefit**: Streamlines the most critical *manual* part of the process: **review and validation**. A dashboard allows you to:
    -   Visualize the current state of the ontology.
    -   Review concepts flagged as `UNCERTAIN` for manual approval.
    -   Track pipeline runs and manage ontology versions.
    -   Quickly identify and correct errors without needing to inspect raw files or databases.

    # Weighted fusion with domain-specific boosts
    composite_score = combine_weighted_similarities(similarities)
    
    # Threshold-based decision with LLM validation
    if composite_score >= 0.95:
        return "MAP_EXACT"
    elif composite_score >= 0.85:
        return llm_validate_similarity(new_concept, best_match)
    elif composite_score >= 0.70:
        return "MANUAL_REVIEW"
    else:
        return "EXTEND_ONTOLOGY"
```

### Technical Property Matching

def match_frequency_ranges(freq1, freq2):
    # Parse frequency specifications (e.g., "2.4-5.8 GHz")
    range1 = parse_frequency_range(freq1)
    range2 = parse_frequency_range(freq2)
    
    # Calculate overlap ratio
    overlap = compute_range_overlap(range1, range2)
